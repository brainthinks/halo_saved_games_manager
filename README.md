# Halo Saved Games Manager

There are multiple variations of Halo that I like to play, and even more that exist out in the wild.  SPV3 (and 1 and 2), the original from the CD, the refined edition, etc. are all installed on my computer, and I would like to play them all at different times.  The problem with this is that there is no way (that I know of) to define what folder the Saved Games are saved in.  SPV3.2 has changed something that allows the games to be stored in a different folder, `C:\Users\user\AppData\Roaming\SPV3`, but I do not see a way to configure this or the original saved games folder at `C:\Users\user\Documents\My Games`.

The problem with this is that if I want to switch between `Halo CE` and `SPV3.1.0f`, I have to first backup my saved games from the default folder, then restore the saved games from the correct variant folder to the default folder.  This is prone to error and forgetfulness.

The goal of this project is to allow me to play any of my halo variants and use my saved games from that variant without having to backup, restore, or manage the files manually.
